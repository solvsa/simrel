\title{
A function to set up a design for a given set of factors with their specific levels
using the MBR-design method.
}
\description{
The multi-level binary replacement (MBR) design approach is used here in order to facilitate the investigation of the effects of 
the data properties on the performance of estimation/prediction methods. The mbrdsim function
takes as input a list containing a set of factors with their levels. The output is an MBR-design
with the combinations of the factor levels to be run.
}
\usage{
	mbrdsim(simlist, fraction, gen=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{simlist}{ A named list containing the levels of a set of (multi-level) factors.}
  \item{fraction}{Design fraction at bit-level. Full design: fraction=0, half-fraction: fraction=1, and so on.}
  \item{gen}{Generators for the fractioning at the bit level. Default is \code{NULL} for which the generators are chosen
automatically by the \code{FrF2} function. See documentation of \code{FrF2} for details on how to set the generators.}
}

\value{
  \item{BitDesign }{The design at bit-factor level. The object is of class design, as output from FrF2. Function design.info()
  can be used to get extra design info of the bit-design. The bit-factors are named.numbered if the input factor list is named.}
  \item{Design }{The design at original factor level, non-randomized. The factors are named if the input factor list is named.}%% ...
