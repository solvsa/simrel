\title{
Function for data simulation
}
\description{
Functions for data simulation from a random regression model with one response variable 
where the data properties can be controlled by a few input parameters. 
The data simulation is based on the concept of relevant latent components 
and relevant predictors, and was developed for the purpose of testing 
methods for variable selection for prediction.

\usage{
simrel(n, p, q, relpos, gamma, R2, ntest = NULL, muY = NULL, muX = NULL, sim = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n}{
The number of (training) samples to generate.
}
  \item{p}{
The total number of predictor variables to generate.
}
  \item{q}{
The number of relevant predictor variables (as a subset of \eqn{p}).
}
  \item{relpos}{
A vector indicating the position (between 1 and \eqn{p}) of the \eqn{m} relevant components, e.g. \eqn{c(1,2)} means that the 
first two latent components should be relevant. The length of relpos must be equal to \eqn{m}.
}
  \item{gamma}{
A number defining the speed of decline in eigenvalues (variances) of the latent components. The eigenvalues are assumed to
decline according to an exponential model. The first eigenvalue is set equal to 1.
}
  \item{R2}{
The theoretical R-squared according to the true linear model. A number between 0 and 1.
}
  \item{ntest}{
The number of test samples to be generated (optional).
}
  \item{muY}{
The true mean of the response variable (optional). Default is muY=NULL.
}
  \item{muX}{
The \code{p}-vector of true means of the predictor variables (optional). Default is muX=NULL.
}
  \item{minlambda}{
Lower bound of the eigenvalues. Defaults to .Machine$double.eps.
}
  \item{sim}{
A fitted simrel object. If this is given, the same regression coefficients will be used to simulate a new data set
of requested size. Default is NULL, for which new regression coefficients are sampled.
}

\details{
The data are simulated according to a multivariate normal model for the vector \eqn{(y, z_1, z_2, z_3, ..., z_p)^t} where \eqn{y} is the response variable and \eqn{z = (z_1,..., z_p)^t} is the vector of latent (principal) components. The ordered principal components are uncorrelated variables with declining variances (eigenvalues) defined for component \eqn{j} as \eqn{e^{-\gamma * j}/e^{-\gamma}}. Hence, the variance (eigenvalue) of the first principal component is equal to 1, and a large value of \eqn{\gamma} gives a rapid decline in the variances. The variance of the response variable is by default fixed equal to 1.

Some of the principal components (ordered by their decreasing variances) are assumed to be relevant for the prediction of the response. The indices of the positions of the relevant components are set by the \code{relpos} argument. The joint degree of relevance for the relevant components is determined by the population R-squared defined by \code{R2}.

In order to obtain predictor variables \eqn{x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_p)^t} for \eqn{y}, a random rotation of the principal components is performed. Hence, \eqn{x = R^t*z} for some random rotation matrix \eqn{R}. For values of \eqn{q} satisfying \eqn{m <= q <p} only a subspace of dimension \eqn{q} containing the \eqn{m} relevant component(s) is rotated. This facilitates the possibility to generate \eqn{q} relevant predictor variables (\eqn{x}'s). The indices of the relevant predictors is randomly selected with the only restriction that the index set contains the indices in \code{relpos}. The final index set of the relevant predictors is saved in the output argument \code{relpred}. If \code{q=p} all \eqn{p} predictor variables are relevant for the prediction of \eqn{y}.

For further details on the simulation approach, please see Sæbø, Almøy and Helland (2015).
